**Notes:**

- Create React App (CRA) was used as per the task requirements. While CRA is currently deprecated, my personal preference for new projects would be Vite due to its performance and modern developer experience.
- Images were optimized by using svg for logos, icons and webp for backgrounds (combined with image-set for responsive loading)
- Spacing values in the design were often very specific (e.g., 17px). To keep the codebase maintainable and enable use of variables, some values were rounded (e.g., 17px â†’ 16px).
- Wasn't sure about drawer background-color, from designs assumed that it's #0D1E48.
